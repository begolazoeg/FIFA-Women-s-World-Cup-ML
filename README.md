# FIFA Women's World Cup Prediction with MLðŸ˜Ž

## Little summary
Hi, this is my first public project on GitHub.  In a nutshell, I'm building as the final project of my AllWomen bootcamp, a (supervised) machine learning model to predict the results of the 2023 women's world cup football tournament. 

## Status of the project
The status of the project is under development, but it will be out of the oven by December 23rd, which is when our bootcamp ends! The dreaded deadline.
 
## Dataset and libraries used
This model is being realized on a jupyter notebook, and I am using the following libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Plt, Sklearn. This last one is used specifically to create the model itself, that is to say to carry out the Logistic Regression. 
To carry out the above, I rely on the dataset provided in Kagle by Mart JÃ¼risoo, [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/womens-international-football-results).
